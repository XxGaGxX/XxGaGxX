- **Web Development:** I’m constantly exploring new frameworks and technologies to build modern, high-performance, and scalable web experiences.
- **AI, Machine & Deep Learning:** I am fascinated by how data can be transformed into knowledge. 
I study and implement models to solve complex problems through machine learning and deep learning.
- **Low-Level & Algorithms:** I love going "under the hood." I use **C** to challenge myself by building optimized algorithms and complex data structures, believing that a deep understanding of memory and hardware is essential for any engineer.
